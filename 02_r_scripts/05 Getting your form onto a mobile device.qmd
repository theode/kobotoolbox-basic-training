Do you recall KoboCollect and Enketo? We will be revisiting these. 

# Enketo web forms

This is perhaps the easiest part of the course. To get your e-form running we can simply click the **Open** button at the "Collect data" part of the page. This will open the form in a new browser page. If you click on **Copy** this will copy the e-form URL which you can then paste in the address bar of any browser.

Within the collect data section we can also:

- Choose the options for submission
- Prevent unauthorised users from submitting data.

## Considerations for using Enketo web forms

Enketo's web forms can be used in any browser. However, not all browsers are created equal. Here are the browsers I recommend for best functionality:

- Microsoft Edge
- Google Chrome (and most of its offshoots)


# KoboCollect

This will be a bit more involved. Firstly you will need to download and install the KoboCollect app on your Android device. Here are the next steps to get started:

1. Click the **K** on the top right to enter the settings.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Click **Server**.
4. Enter the URL to your KoboToolbox account.

Here is how you can access your e-forms:

1. Click **Download form**.
2. Select the forms you'd like to download and click **Get selected**.
3. Back at the home screen, select **Start new form**.
4. Select the form you want to open to collect your data.
