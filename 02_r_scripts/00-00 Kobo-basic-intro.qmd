His work with data earned him double awards in 2010 for Junior Public Officer of the Year and Public Officer of the Year and enabled his ministry to obtain second place at the United Nations Excellence in Public Service Awards in 2011 for the Latin America and Caribbean region. He holds a Master of Science degree in natural resource and environmental management.

His relevant experience includes database development and management, data collection and surveys, data analysis, geospatial data analysis, data visualization, and reporting.

2. Discussion *(some knowledge shared **between** me to you)*
3. Hands-on exercises *(something to keep your hands busy for a bit)*
4. Quizzes *(so we can see how much you've learned)*
5. Maybe some *homework* *(so you don't forget what was said and done ...hopefully)* :)
