# All about the data!

**We all know that data is important**. Field data collection is a critical aspect of the work of many organizations, including government departments. As the need for *evidence-based* *decision-making* becomes more apparent and sought after by practitioners of good governance, so does the need for securing that data from primary sources, often in the field, rapidly, but reliably and accurately.

Traditionally, paper-based data collection programmes were used to collect data in the field. However, the utility of this data is severely limited unless it is first computerized into a spreadsheet or database before any meaningful analysis can be carried out. 

Alternatively, mobile data collection systems exist. This enables speedier data collection, built-in validation for data entered, and a streamlining of data workflows. One such tool which can be used for mobile data collection is **KoboToolbox**. Therefore, the opportunity exists to make data collection an easier proposition for departments which need it most as part of their work programmes.

Unfortunately, the skills necessary to build electronic data collection forms in **KoboToolbox** may not be present within the existing workforce, nor the expertise to access the data from the repository for use. Additionally, the use of new technologies, including mobile data collection in the field, requires some level of familiarity to be truly effective and transformative to the workflow of the department. Hence the necessity for training.

**Derrick Theophille** is the Chief Fisheries Officer at the Fisheries Division, but for over fifteen years has worked as the Fisheries Officer responsible for resource assessment, fisheries statistics, and databases. His work with data earned him double awards in 2010 for Junior Public Officer of the Year and Public Officer of the Year and enabled his ministry to obtain second place at the United Nations Excellence in Public Service Awards in 2011 for the Latin America and Caribbean region. He holds a Master of Science degree in natural resource and environmental management.

His relevant experience includes database development and management, data collection and surveys, data analysis, geospatial data analysis, data visualization, and reporting. He has worked to transition the data collection system of the Fisheries Division and Division of Agriculture to incorporate mobile data collection systems and the use of R for improving and streamlining data workflows.

Derrick is also a pioneer of advances in fisheries data within the Caribbean region. Currently, he heads the Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism (CRFM) Data Methods and Training Working Group (DMTWG) and leads monthly sessions for fisheries counterparts across the region in R for fisheries statistics and stock assessments. He has shared much of his knowledge with his colleagues across the region and assisted with their data transformation progress.

# Data and You

- Tell me about yourself and your relationship to data collection
- Do you have any data collection experience?

# What to expect?

## Who is this course for?

This course is for you if you are:

- New to or curious about mobile data collection, KoboToolbox
- Involved or interested in data collection and management

## Are there any prerequisites?

*Should I be computer-literate?*

- It certainly helps if you know how to use a computer or other similar device. If you have some computing experience and willing to learn some more, you should be fine.

*What about computers or mobile devices?*

- Forms can be developed, deployed, managed, used for data collection from a wide range of devices (computers, tablets, or smart phones) or operating systems (MacOS, Windows, Linux, Android). Do have a reliable device handy for the duration of the training and for use afterwards with your own data collection activities.

## *How* will *we* learn?

Yes! I expect to learn from you too! Your humble trainer does not know it all, no matter how smart you think he is!

We will have:

1. Lectures *(some knowledge shared from me to you)*
2. Discussion *(some knowledge shared **between** me and you)*
3. Hands-on practical exercises *(something to keep your hands busy for a bit)*
4. Quizzes *(so we can see how much you've learned)*
5. Maybe some *homework* *(so you don't forget what was said and done ...hopefully)* :)
