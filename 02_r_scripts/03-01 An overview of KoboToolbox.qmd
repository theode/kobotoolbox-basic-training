- KoboToolbox is a suite of applications providing an open source data collection tool for working in **"challenging"** environments, such as humanitarian and human rights, global development, and environmental protection cases. But it is not limited to only these areas.
- It is designed to address many of the shortcomings of mobile data collection.
- KoboToolbox lends reliability, accuracy, speed, data quality, analysis and cost effectiveness to mobile data collection.
- Works for data collection **offline** or **online** on virtually any device.
- It is useful for much more than data collection. It can also be used for managing and visualizing collected data.
- Its main features are free to use.

## Some background to KoboToolbox

- KoboToolbox was developed by the **Harvard Humanitarian Initiative** in association with Brigham and Women’s Hospital and USAID.
- KoboToolbox is hosted and maintained by an international nonprofit organisation called **Kobo**, registered in Cambridge Massachusetts, United States. This organisation was established in 2019 to ensure that KoboToolbox could be maintained sustainably for the long-term and develop further.
- Other partners include the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA).
- KoboToolbox is being used by **>14,000** organisations around the world. This includes 
  - the International Office for Migration (IOM), 
  - Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), 
  - the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), 
  - the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), 
  - Save the Children, 
  - the African Development Bank, 
  - the World Bank Group,

  - the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO),
  - and the Joint Data Center on Forced Displacement (JDC).

- Other?


# KoboToolbox Features

## Web Formbuilder

<img src="formbuilder1_src-kobo.png" alt="Web form builder. *Source: Kobo*" width="700"/>

The web formbuilder allows for the designing of very basic to fairly complex and intuitive and *powerful* electronic forms or questionnaires. It has 25 quantitative and qualitative question types to choose from:

  - text (short or long/memo), 
  - numeric (integer or decimal), 
  - date and time, 
  - single- or multi-select, 
  - ranges, 
  - ranks,
  - images or photos,
  - audio, 
  - video, 
  - geospatial (points, traces or lines, shapes),
  - barcodes,
  - calculations,
  - and much more.

Additionally, the formbuilder helps you add in many useful features to your forms to ensure high quality data is collected efficiently. These include:
 - skip logic, 
 - validation, 
 - and even language translation.

## Question Library

The question library helps you keep your questions standardized. You can also create templates which can be reused in future forms. Or, you can browse the public collections for question inspirations or simply include them in your questionnaire project.

## Data collection via mobile app or Web browser

<img src="enketo1_src-kobo.png" alt="Using Enketo web forms. *Source: Kobo*" width="700"/>

As previously mentioned, KoboToolbox can be used online or offline for data collection, using virtually any device. In practice this can be done in two ways:

1. **KoboCollect**: This is an Android app which connects to a KoboToolbox server to access eforms, collect data, and submit data. This app is free on Google Play (<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.koboc.collect.android>). of course, this option is only available to Android devices or devices which can emulate an Android Operating System.

2. **Web forms**: Enketo web forms, an open source software application, is used by KoboToolbox to display and receive responses from your eforms. This option can be used on any device which can run a browser.

## Data Repository: Management and Reporting
This is where the data you have collected will be stored and made available for you to access, manage, review. Additionally you may view a pre-made report complete with visualizations. Lastly, you can find your data available for download in several formats (including XLS, CSV, KML, ZIP, and GeoJSON).

## Project (survey) management
All of the features we've discussed so far is managed within a project in KoboToolbox. This means the questionnaire can be shared with a team for co-development. Or perhaps you need a colleague to assist with validating or editing the incoming data. permissions can be set for each user appropriately, as required for each project or survey. 

One more thing you can do here is link projects! Perhaps we will discuss more on this in a future course. :)

# The KoboToolbox Workflow

This is how KoboToolbox can fit within your data workflow:

1. Draft your questionnaire.
2. Digitize the questionnaire using the web formbuilder, creating an e-form or e-questionnaire.
3. The completed e-form is then deployed for data collection. There are several options for deploying, based on your needs. Restrictions can also be set to prevent unauthorized users from submitting data.

4. The e-form is piloted and reviewed, as needed. Both the KoboCollect app and the Enketo web form can be used to see how your enumerators and prospective respondents will use the e-form.
5. The survey is administered. Records coming in can be monitored in the data repository. Records can be validated (approved, put on hold or not approved) or edited, as needed.
6. When the survey is done or I need to make a report I can download my data. Or, I can use a more fancy option, such as **R**, to automate the process. :)
