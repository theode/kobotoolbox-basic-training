As you may have noticed, electronic data collection can be used in the work place as well as in the field. We will focus on field data collection in this section.

# Before going on the field (before data collection)

It is good practice to be prepared before going into the field to collect data.

- Ensure that the mobile device is fully charged. Depending on device power consumption, you may opt to carry replacement batteries or back-up power sources, based on the device. Or you may choose to carry a second, charged, device.
- Make sure the latest version of the e-form is loaded on to the device. It is also a good idea to test the e-form, while connected to the internet, just to confirm that the e-form is properly loaded.
- If you require additional accessories, supplies, and tools which support your data collection work or your device specifically, make sure those are kept along with your device.
- If the device uses a case and screen protector for added protection, install those now.

# While on the field (while collecting data)

- Keep the device and accessories safe and secure, especially when when not in use.
- Tablets should only be used for data collection activities
- Never let the device leave your sight. Avoid lending the device to other people.
- Pay attention to your battery life.
- If you need to collect geospatial data, ensure that the device's location functionality is turned on and the browser or app being used for data collection has access to that location information captured by your device.
- Proceed with the e-form as intended and complete the questionnaire, as applicable. Submit the e-form when completed.

# Return from field (after data collection)

- If you were offline while on the field, make sure internet connectivity is restored to the device when back from the field. Open the browser or app and verify that the records submitted have been successfully sent from the device to the KoboToolbox repository. 
- Clean the device from dirt/soil, liquid, etc.
- Put the device to charge.
- Designate a safe place to keep and securely store the devices when not in use. For example in a locked cabinet.
- Proper care and maintenance should be adhered to at all times.


# Recap and next steps

Let's recap. So far you have learned: 

- The importance of data
- The difference between paper and electronic data collection methods
- The basics of designing a survey and developing a good questionnaire
- What is KoboToolbox and been introduced to its features
- How to create a KoboToolbox account, create a basic e-questionnaire and deploy it
- How to use a mobile device for data collection in the field

Now what?
